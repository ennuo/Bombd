    // These codes are shared between TCP and RDUP, so some are used in TCP and not in RUDP and vice versa
    // 
    // RUDP seems to be a custom implementation. Its intresting cause it seems to be a hybrid of regular UDP and RUDP.
    // The sender can choose if they want an acknowledement back or not, I imagine this is done for performance reasons.
    // As an example, you dont want to wait for an acknowledgement when broadcasting player positions, it wastes time.
    // 
    // A typical connection init is as follows:
    // Client->Server: SYN
    // Server->Client: ACK-SYN
    // Server->Client: SYN
    // Client->Server: ACK-SYN
    // 
    // The rest of the protocol follows this similarly. For example, to send NetcodeData:
    // Client->Server: NetcodeData(SEQ 0)
    // Client->Server: NetcodeData(SEQ 1)
    // Server->Client: ACK-NetcodeData(SEQ 0)
    // Server->Client: ACK-NetcodeData(SEQ 1)
    // 
    // As sequence numbers are involved, I assume the packets need to be re-ordered once theyre all recieved,
    // ACKs are only sent out once all packets have been recieved. I need to figure out how to tell how many to expect.
    // 
    // You get the idea, its similar to TCP but with the flexibility and performance of UDP when its required
    // 
    // PS: Assuming 0x67 is FIN, a completely wild guess, but I dont know what else it could be
    // 
    // All RUDP communication is signed (apart from a few packets). All packets that ARE signed use the HMAC-MD5 algorithm
    // with a salt (that I believe is appended to the key data somehow). The resulting MD5 hash is then reduced to 16 bits
    // using some bit shifting algorithm. NOTE that NetcodeData packets use this same algorithm, but 32 bits instead of 16.
    // 
    // Signatures are stored in different locations depending on the packet type, all packet types have different header layouts.
